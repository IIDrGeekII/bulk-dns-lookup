# bulk-dns-lookup
A simple Windows batch script that performs bulk DNS lookups for a list of domains/URLs and saves the results to a CSV file.

Bulk DNS lookup for Windows. Reads domains from a file, resolves IPs via nslookup, prints a neat table, and exports results to a timestamped CSV.

1. Prepare your input file:
     Create a plain text file with one domain/URL per line, e.g., #### *urls.txt*:
      ```
      google.com
      github.com
      example.org
      invalid-domain.test
      ```
### *Note: Place it in the same folder as bulk-dns-lookup.bat (or note its full path).*
